**"AI4C - Artificial Intelligence for Creatives"** by Nye Warburton with the assistance of several artificially intelligent models. 

This networked book was created with the writing assistance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, an AI language model developed by Anthropic. Narrative organization and structure done using Obsidian, a knowledge management application that allows for networked thought and easy linking between ideas. Images are generated using Leonardo.ai - using a variety of stable diffusion models. 

The book's content is hosted and version-controlled on GitHub, allowing for collaborative development and easy updates. For long-term preservation and provenance, key versions of the book are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. 

This networked, ever-evolving book reflects the dynamic nature of its subject matter - the intersection of artificial intelligence and human creativity.
