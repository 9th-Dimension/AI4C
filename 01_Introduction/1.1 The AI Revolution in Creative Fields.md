## Personal Story: "Train the Model"

My introduction to Artificial Intelligence in creative technology occurred on a motion capture stage in Los Angeles. As an animation technologist with experience in animation and media production, I was working with a facial capture system for a project. While adjusting the system's settings, I encountered a pivotal moment that would reshape my understanding of creative technology.

Motion capture technology, traditionally used to record human movements for animation, has evolved to incorporate a subsection of Artificial Intelligence, called **Machine Learning**. We'll cover this in more detail in later in the book, but for now, understand that this evolution allowed for more nuanced capture and even the generation of new movements, expanding the possibilities in animation and virtual performance.

The turning point came when I was configuring the facial capture system. Excited by the technology, I was rapidly adjusting various settings. A developer on the project intervened, saying, "Slow down. You haven't let the model train." 

This statement completely threw my brain into a loop. It was at that moment I realized that the software I was using was **"learning."**

>**"Training the model"** refers to the process where an AI system actually learns from data to improve its performance. 

In this context, the facial capture system I was using needed time to analyze and adapt to the specific facial features and expressions it was recording. 

This concept is fundamental to how AI operates in creative tools.

This experience led me to investigate machine learning and its applications in creative fields. I realized that AI was not just a feature in some tools, but a transformative force in the creative industry.

# AI's Impact on Traditional Creative Workflows

The integration of AI into creative processes is fundamentally altering how artists, designers, and other creatives approach their work. This is happening now due to our networked world, massive computing capability, and most importantly more digital data that has ever been created before. 

Simply put, Artificial intelligence is transforming creative workflows by **automating time-consuming tasks** and **providing creative collaboration.** 

**These tools can:**

>1. Generate initial concepts or drafts based on specified parameters
>2. Automate repetitive tasks, freeing creatives to focus on higher-level decision-making
>3. Offer alternative ideas or solutions, potentially inspiring new creative directions
>4. Be there to converse with about ideas, shaping them, evolving them and playing with them at every moment.

For example, in graphic design, AI can suggest color palettes, generate layout options, or even create initial mock-ups based on project briefs. In writing, AI assistants can produce first drafts, suggest edits, or help with research. This benefit extends to coding, and as AI develops, will extend to extensive workflows such as animation and film. 

This is not a matter of will it, but a matter of when.

The key benefit is not replacement of human creativity, **but augmentation.** 

AI assistants handle routine aspects of creative work, allowing humans to devote more time and energy to the uniquely human aspects of creativity: original thinking, emotional resonance, and contextual understanding.

### Key points about AI in creative processes:

>
>1. **AI can analyze and learn** from vast amounts of data, including images, movements, and styles.
>
>2. It can **generate new content based on learned patterns,** assisting in ideation and production.
>
>3. AI tools adapt to user preferences and behaviors, potentially **enhancing individual creative processes.**
>
>4. **The technology is rapidly evolving**, with new applications emerging regularly in various creative domains.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for creatives looking to leverage AI effectively in their work. While AI offers exciting possibilities, it's important to approach it as a tool *that enhances, rather than replaces,* human creativity. 


### The Exponential Growth of AI 


There is extraordinary growth in the research and capability of artificial intelligence, making for a rapidly evolving and changing landscape of software.

Some facts about the above graph:

- *In 2015, there were approximately 5,000 AI papers published.*

- *By 2020, this number had grown to over 25,000 papers.*

- *Projections for 2025 - we could see upwards of 100,000 AI papers published in a single year.*


I first considered publishing this book, as a printed book. But the medium of AI means that nothing will be complete. Things will become rapidly outdated. As such, I chose to make this book, **networked** and **AI enhanced.**

The field of Artificial Intelligence is experiencing unprecedented growth, with research and development accelerating at a pace that challenges our ability to keep up. This rapid expansion has significant implications for creatives and professionals across various industries.



This growth isn't just in quantity. 

The quality and diversity of AI research are also expanding, with breakthroughs in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and generative models.

### Implications for Creatives

The rapid advancement of AI research has direct consequences for creative fields:


1. **New Tools and Techniques:** Research breakthroughs quickly translate into new creative tools, **often within months of publication.**

2. **Shifting Job Landscape:** As AI capabilities expand, the skills required in creative industries are evolving, **necessitating ongoing learning and adaptation.**

3. **Ethical Considerations:** The pace of development raises important questions about AI's impact on creativity, authorship, and the value of human-generated work.


### Staying Updated: A Necessity, Not an Option

Given this rapid pace of change, staying informed about AI developments is crucial for creatives:

- Regular engagement with AI tools helps maintain relevant skills.

- Understanding AI capabilities informs strategic career decisions.

- Awareness of AI trends allows creatives to anticipate and adapt to industry changes.

While the task of staying updated may seem daunting, numerous resources are available, from online courses to AI-focused newsletters and podcasts. The key is to make continuous learning a habit, treating it as an essential part of professional development in the AI age.

It is near impossible to stay up to date on the industry. This is why I advise following people on social media, specifically as they interact and discuss the nature of the industry. Staying current with what is going on, and identifying *what is hype and what is reality,* will become increasingly critical for successful use of artificial intelligence.

Here is a selected list of resources I find useful. I encourage you to do your own research, and let me know if you feel any of this information is false or incorrect.
